This page gathers an information on other routers for React and other notably
examples of routing in Web applications.

  * react-router_ — library for React which provides a routing modelled after
    Ember routing and thus it's very powerful and thoughtful. Some of RRouter
    features were inspired by react-router.

  * `Ember Routing`_ — Ember web framework provides powerful routing features.

  * react-router-component_ — library for React which treats routing as a
    control structure and configure it in a ``render()`` method of a React
    component. RRouter was developed to replace react-router-component and fix
    design flaws introduced by it.

  * `Backbone Router`_ — Backbone library provides a routing solution which can
    be used in React applications.
